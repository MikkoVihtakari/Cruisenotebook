# Cruisenotebook
Create a quick cruise summary report detailing the survey track, trawl catches, acoustic registrations, CTD data, and other observations during or after a cruise. Can be set up to read data direcly from the servers on board.

There are currently two versions of the script tailored to the Barents Sea Ecosystem Survey and the Winter survey, with instructions found in the files "REDME_BESS.pdf/.Rmd" and "README_winter_survey.pdf/.Rmd"
